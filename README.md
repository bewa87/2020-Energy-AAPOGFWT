# 2020 - Annual Averaged Power Output Generation for Wind Turbines

In this project, we develop a new flexible framework for annual averaged power output generation prediction for wind turbines based on Weibull distributions and logistic regression of power curve modelling for wind turbines. To get the required wind speed data, we recommend to access the open data server of the German Weather Service (DWD - https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/hourly/wind/historical/). The data for power curve modelling can be obtained from https://www.wind-turbine-models.com/ for the respective manufacturers' wind turbines.

Since our approach bases on R and GNU Octave, we can easily replace probability density functions or power curve models and our framework is therefore relatively flexible.
